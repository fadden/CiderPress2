<div class="markdown-heading"><h2 class="heading-element">General</h2><a aria-label="Permalink: General" class="anchor" href="#user-content-general" id="user-content-general" name="user-content-general"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazer%27s_Interactive_Symbolic_Assembler" rel="nofollow">LISA</a> is an assembler
for Apple II code written by Randall Hyde.  The name is pronounced "LI ZA" rather than "LE SA".</p>
<p>The program kept the source file in tokenized form, which reduced the memory footprint and
the time required to assemble code.  This is true for all versions, although the file format
evolved significantly over time.</p>
<p>Version 2.x ran under DOS.  Version 3.x ran under ProDOS, and was the last for 8-bit computers.
Versions 4 and 5 were branded "LISA 8/16", and added support for the Apple IIgs.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h2 class="heading-element">v2 Format</h2><a aria-label="Permalink: v2 Format" class="anchor" href="#user-content-v2-format" id="user-content-v2-format" name="user-content-v2-format"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>The file structure is fairly straightforward:</p>
<pre><code>+$00 / 2: program version? - usually $1800, which might indicate v2.4 (* 10 * 256)
+$02 / 2: length of file data; needed because DOS 3.3 doesn't store this for alternate B
+$04 /nn: series of lines
</code></pre>
<p>Each line is:</p>
<pre><code>+$00 / 1: line length (does not include length byte)
+$01 /nn: data
+$xx / 1: end-of-line marker ($0d)
</code></pre>
<p>The last line in the file has a length of 255 ($ff).  The last length byte is followed by two
more $ff bytes.</p>
<p>The line data is a mix of plain text and tokens.  The tokenization was primarily applied to the
instruction mnemonics.</p>
<p>Lines starting with '*' or ';' are full-line comments.  Lines starting with an upper-case letter
are code lines that start with a label, lines starting with a caret (^) have a local (numeric)
label, and lines starting with a space do not have a label.  All other characters are invalid at
the start of a line.  If present, regular labels always take 8 bytes in the source file, and
local labels take 7 bytes, padded with trailing spaces if necessary.  If the label is terminated
with a colon, it will be included at the end.</p>
<p>If the label is on a line by itself, the next character will be the end-of-line marker.  If not,
the next byte will be the encoded opcode or pseudo-op mnemonic, with a value &gt;= 0x80.</p>
<p>The opcode is followed by a byte that indicates the contents of the operand field.  It will be $00
if there is no operand, $01 for absolute addressing, $02 for immediate, $05 for direct page
indirect indexed Y), and so on. Operands that should be taken literally, e.g.
<code>ASC "HELLO, WORLD!"</code>, use $20.  The text of the operand follows.</p>
<p>If the line has a comment, it will be preceded by $bb (high-ASCII semicolon).  Because that value
cannot appear in a valid operand, the end of the operand can be identified unambiguously, and thus
it's not necessary to track open/close quotes when converting lines to text.  Lines without
comments will follow the operand with $0d.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h2 class="heading-element">v3 Format</h2><a aria-label="Permalink: v3 Format" class="anchor" href="#user-content-v3-format" id="user-content-v3-format" name="user-content-v3-format"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Auxtypes $17fc, $1800, $1ffc, $2000, $26fc, and $27fc have been seen.</p>
<p>The file format looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>+$00 / 2: length of code section, in bytes
+$02 / 2: length of symbol table, in bytes
+$04 /nn: symbol table, 0-512 entries, 8 bytes each
+$xx /yy: code
</code></pre>
<p>Symbol table entries are 8 bytes each:</p>
<pre><code>+$00 / 6: 8-character label, packed into 6 bytes
+$06 / 2: value? (usually zero)
</code></pre>
<p>The code section is a series of lines with a complex encoding.  All symbols are encoded as
references to the symbol table, so the text of each symbol is only stored once.  Numeric values
and operators used in operands are encoded.</p>
<p>At least one file has been found that appears to use a different table of opcode mnemonics.  The
file "anix.equates" appears in some ANIX distributions, and has the same filetype and auxtype as
other source files.  However, even though it appears to decode successfully, all of the opcodes
are incorrect.  Curiously, the ANIX 2.1 command "LPRINT" can successfully convert "anix.equates"
to text, but generates incorrect output for LISA v3.1 source files.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h2 class="heading-element">v4/v5 Format</h2><a aria-label="Permalink: v4/v5 Format" class="anchor" href="#user-content-v4v5-format" id="user-content-v4v5-format" name="user-content-v4v5-format"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Auxtypes $40e8, $40e9, and $50e1 have been seen.  A filename suffix of ".A" is commonly used.</p>
<p>The file format looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>+$00 / 2: version number
+$02 / 2: offset of first byte past end of symbol table
+$04 / 2: symbol count
+$06 / 1: tab position for opcodes
+$07 / 1: tab position for operands
+$08 / 1: tab position for comments
+$09 / 1: CPU type
+$0a / 6: (reserved)
+$10 /nn: symbol table
+$xx /yy: code
</code></pre>
<p>The symbol table is a series of strings that have a preceding length and are null terminated.  The
length byte includes the null termination and the length byte itself.</p>
<p>The code section is a series of lines with a complex encoding, similar in overall structure to v3
but extended.</p>
