# Replace blocks of text in an HTML document with the contents of a file.
#
# For example:
#   <div id="masthead">
#       <!-- START: /masthead-incl.html -->
#       <script>$("#masthead").load("/masthead-incl.html");</script>
#       <!-- END: /masthead-incl.html -->
#   </div>
#
# Only the lines between START/END are replaced.  The START/END lines are
# left in place so the process can be performed repeatedly without needing
# a separate ".in" file.
#
# Occurrences of "${ROOT}" in the include file will be replaced with the
# relative path to the root of the hierarchy.  This is useful for shared
# top navigation bars.
#
#
# Run this from the top-level directory.  Provide a list of all HTML files
# on the command line, using relative paths.
#
# If the name of the file to include (specified on the START line) begins
# with '/', the file will be loaded from the top-level directory, i.e. the
# one where this command was run.  If not, the file will be read from the
# directory where the HTML file lives.
